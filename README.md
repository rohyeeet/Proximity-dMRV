# Proximity

Proximity is an MRV (Measurement, Reporting, Verification) platform for climate and carbon
programs. It lets an organization — a biochar producer, a green hydrogen plant, an ARR (afforestation
/ reforestation / revegetation) collective — model their entire data-collection and verification
process (what gets recorded, in what order, by whom, reviewed by whom) as configuration, not code,
and then actually run that process: field teams submit real records, reviewers approve or return
them, and every submission stays tied to the exact form definition it was collected under, forever.

It is multi-tenant (`Organization`), multi-domain (`DomainPack` — biochar and green hydrogen are the
two shipped today), and role-gated end to end, from the UI down to the database write.

## What it does

A carbon program has to prove, years later, exactly what was measured, by whom, under what
definition, and that nothing was quietly changed after the fact. Proximity is built around that
constraint:

- **Studio** — build the process itself: the *Stages* it moves through, the *Forms* captured at
  each stage, and the *Flow* (a visual graph) that ties them together with review gates, branches,
  and correction loops.
- **Connectors** — register the data sources a form can pull from or push to: internal lookups,
  external databases/REST APIs, or industrial protocols (OPC-UA, Modbus, MQTT/Sparkplug B) feeding
  live telemetry from devices.
- **Collect** — a mobile-first app for the field submitter role: the forms assigned to *them*,
  filled out with real device capture (camera photos, signature pad, GPS point/boundary walking,
  document scan) and submitted for review.
- **Records** — every submission against a published form, in one row-wise validation table: one
  column per question, evidence photos/documents and captured geo-boundaries reviewable inline
  (a real map, not raw coordinates), CSV-exportable, and every cell rendered against the *exact*
  field definition it was submitted under — even after the form has since changed, with fields
  added or removed since clearly marked rather than silently blank.
- **Analytics** — program-level rollups (throughput, review backlog, telemetry health), computed
  live from each organization's own submission/device rows, not seed data.
- **Admin** — platform-tier oversight across every organization and domain pack.
- **Payments (Proximity Pay)** — the money side of the same lifecycle: milestone-gated offtake
  agreements, evidence-backed claims, multi-stakeholder consent, a KYC/BAV dual gate with per-
  recipient partial blocking, and a hash-chained audit trail, settled through a deliberately fake
  simulated PSP. See [Payments (Proximity Pay)](#payments-proximity-pay).

Every read path above is tenant-isolated: a query always scopes to the caller's own organization(s),
even when multiple organizations share the same `DomainPack`.

                         PostgreSQL (Neon, serverless)
```

- **Auth**: Auth.js v5 (Credentials provider), bcrypt-hashed passwords, JWT session. `middleware.ts`
  redirects unauthenticated requests to `/login`; `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx` resolves the session
  server-side and hydrates the client `SessionProvider`/`StudioProvider`.
- **Client state**: `src/lib/studio.tsx` holds Stages/Forms/Flows in React Context, seeded from the
  server on load. Edits apply optimistically and flush to the database via a 600ms-debounced
  `PATCH`, so typing feels instant but every keystroke doesn't fire a request.
- **Authorization is enforced twice, on purpose**: client components hide edit affordances a role
  shouldn't see (UX), and every mutating Route Handler independently re-checks via
  `src/lib/authz.ts` (security) — hiding a button never stops a direct API call.
- **Persistence**: JSONB is used deliberately (not as a shortcut) for structures that are always
  read/written as one unit and never queried field-by-field in SQL — form field definitions, flow
  node/edge graphs, submission answers. Everything that's ever filtered, joined, or counted in SQL
  (ids, statuses, foreign keys, sort order) is a real column.
- **Multi-tenant isolation**: a `DomainPack` (e.g. biochar) can be shared by several `Organization`s.
  Every read path that touches submissions, forms, flows, or stages threads the caller's own
  `organizationId` through the query (`src/lib/queries.ts`) rather than scoping by domain pack alone
  — one org can never read, export, or enumerate another org's records or process designs.
- **File uploads**: photo, signature, document-scan, and geo-boundary evidence upload directly from
  the browser to Vercel Blob storage via short-lived, auth-gated client tokens
  (`src/app/api/uploads/route.ts`) — file bytes never pass through the Next.js server, avoiding
  serverless body-size limits.
- **Race-safe record linking**: when a form field links to another org's already-submitted record
  and marks it exclusive (e.g. "this transport leg can only be claimed by one dispatch"), the claim
  is re-checked inside a `Serializable`-isolation Postgres transaction at submit time, not just when
  listing candidates — two submitters can't both claim the same upstream record.

## Domain model

```
DomainPack ("Biochar — Isometric & Puro", "Green Hydrogen — Electrolysis to Certification")
   │
   ├── Organization (a tenant running that domain's process — e.g. "Varaha South")
   │      ├── Role (tiered permission sets, some org-wide, some scoped to a project cluster)
   │      ├── OrgMembership (a User ⇄ Role binding, per org)
   │      └── Connector (a registered data source, org-scoped) ── Device ── TelemetryStream
   │
   ├── Stage (an ordered step in the process — "Feedstock Intake", "Pyrolysis Run", ...)
   │      └── owns an ordered list of FormTemplate ids and Connector ids
   │
   ├── FormTemplate (a reusable form definition — "Facility Setup", "Sample Intake COA")
   │      └── FormTemplateVersion (append-only history: "draft" while being edited,
   │           "published" and immutable forever once published — never mutated again)
   │
   ├── FlowTemplate (the visual graph tying Stages/Forms/reviews/automation together)
   │      └── FlowNodeDefinition[] / FlowEdgeDefinition[] — kept in sync with Stages by
   │           the sync engine (src/lib/flow-sync.ts), but hand-editable beyond that backbone
   │
   └── Submission (a real record — pinned to the FormTemplateVersion it was submitted under,
          so answers always render against the fields that existed at submission time,
          regardless of how many times the form has been republished since)
```

**Why versions matter**: publishing a form doesn't overwrite anything. The current draft flips to
`published` and becomes permanent history; the next edit opens a brand-new draft row. A submission
from v1 keeps rendering against v1's exact fields even after the form is on v5 — Records shows a
banner when a submission's pinned version is stale relative to the form's current version, and
`Notification` rows are fanned out to every past (non-test) submitter plus the publisher whenever a
form changes.

Payments (see [below](#payments-proximity-pay)) hangs its own tree off `Organization`, parallel to
the MRV domain above, sharing only `Organization`/`User`:

```
Organization
   │
   └── PaymentAgreement (buyer, project org, milestone schedule, split rule set)
          ├── Milestone (typed: setup_capex | achievement | monitoring_cycle)
          │      ├── MilestoneClaim (a ground partner's claimed amount + evidence)
          │      │      ├── EvidenceAttachment
          │      │      └── StakeholderConsent (one per required role: investor / platform_ops / registry)
          │      └── PayoutInstruction (one per revenue-split participant, gate-checked)
          │             └── GateOverride (dual sign-off, when KYC/BAV blocks a payout)
          ├── PaymentAgreementParty (grants an investor/registry User access — not an OrgMembership)
          ├── PayoutRecipient (a developer/farmer-community recipient's KYC/BAV status)
          ├── EscrowAccount (held balance; interest computed live, never a stale stored number)
          └── PaymentAuditLogEntry (hash-chained, append-only)
```

## User personas & permissions

Permission is a **tier** (`RoleTier`), not a single global toggle — a user's tier can differ per
organization membership, and platform tier is cross-org.

| Tier | Example role (seeded) | Can edit Studio? | Can delete a Stage? | Notes |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| `platform` | Super Admin | ✅ | ✅ | Cross-org, not tied to any one `OrgMembership`. |
| `org_admin` | Org Admin | ✅ | ✅ | Full control of one organization. |
| `org_sub_admin` | Regional Ops Sub-Admin | ✅ | ❌ | Delegated admin scoped to a project cluster; can build but not destroy. |
| `designer` | — | ✅ | ❌ | Studio-editing only, no admin actions. |
| `reviewer` | Lab Technician, Plant QA Engineer | ❌ (view-only) | ❌ | Approves/returns submissions. |
| `submitter` | Field Surveyor | ❌ (view-only) | ❌ | Fills out forms in the field. |
| `viewer` | — | ❌ | ❌ | Read-only across the board. |

Stage deletion is deliberately **stricter** than general Studio editing (`canDeleteStage` vs.
`canEditStudio` in `src/lib/permissions.ts`) — irreversible actions are gated to admin tiers only,
confirmed via a modal, enforced server-side in `requireStageDeleteAccess`.

Every persona above is real seed data (`src/data/identity.ts`) and logs in with their real email +
the shared demo password — see [Local development](#local-development).

**Payments' two extra personas — investor and registry — are deliberately *not* another `RoleTier`.**
They need visibility into a specific `PaymentAgreement` regardless of organization, not "membership"
in whatever org happens to own it, so access is granted by a dedicated `PaymentAgreementParty`
junction table instead (checked independently of the tier table above). Their seeded login still
carries a minimal `viewer`-tier `OrgMembership`, purely so the existing session/org-switcher plumbing
works unchanged for them — that membership grants them nothing on its own.

## Features

### Overview
The landing dashboard — current flow health, what's blocked, and where to look next, computed live
from the org's own submissions:
- **Flow summary table** — one row per form referenced by the active flow, with an
  **approved/pending/rejected** breakdown, **approval rate**, **average SLA** (time from submission
  to first approval), and the **top rejection reason(s)** pulled from real review-action history.
- **Bottleneck and drop-off callouts** — which stage currently has the most submissions waiting
  (the process bottleneck) and which stage has the highest return-for-correction rate (where the
  process is losing the most work), rolled up from the form-level numbers above.
- **Tracker column** — see "Tracker" under Flow Studio below; any node's live metric surfaces here
  automatically once configured.

### Studio
- **Stage board** — ordered stages, each owning a set of forms and connectors; reorder, rename
  inline (pencil-icon editing, not "everything looks editable"), delete (admin-only, confirmed).
- **Form builder** — drag-in field types (text, number, date, geo-point/boundary, photo, document
  scan, signature, lookup, linked record, calculated field, repeat group), validation rules,
  conditional visibility rules, lookup sources bound to Connectors, link filters between forms.
  - **Preview** — live render of the form as an end user would see it, with a **Desktop/Mobile**
    viewport toggle, and a **Submit test response** action that creates a real, isolated test
    `Submission` (never appears in Records or production counts) so a form can be validated before
    it's published.
- **Flow Studio** — a `@xyflow/react` canvas for the process graph: form steps, branches, review
  gates, correction loops, automations, parallel groups, waits, documents, explicit `start` and
  `milestone` (terminal) nodes. Bigger nodes and connection handles, a collapsible module palette,
  **contextual "suggested next step" buttons** in the node inspector (e.g. a review gate suggests
  a correction loop, a document, or a milestone), a **fullscreen mode** for building large graphs,
  auto-arrange (layered topological layout), and structural validation (dangling edges, unmarked
  cycles, unreachable nodes, missing start/milestone nodes, branches with fewer than two paths).
  "Sync from stages" reconciles the flow's backbone with the current Stage list without discarding
  hand-built detours like review gates.
  - **Tracker** — any form-linked node can define a live operational metric: pick one of that
    form's numeric fields and an aggregation (**SUM / AVG / MIN / MAX**, a dropdown) to roll up
    across that form's submissions — e.g. average facility capacity, total tonnage processed.
    Computed fresh on every load (never cached) and surfaced on the Overview flow summary.
- **Knowledge base** — inline contextual help (`InfoHint`/`KnowledgeDrawer`) explaining Studio
  concepts without leaving the builder.

### Connectors
Register internal lookups, external database/REST sources, or industrial-protocol devices
(OPC-UA / Modbus / MQTT-Sparkplug B) that forms can bind to for live dropdowns or telemetry-fed
automation. Each connector rolls up its bound `Device`s and their `TelemetryStream`s.

### Collect (field submitter app)
A separate, mobile-first surface (`/collect`) for the `submitter` role — not the Studio chrome, just
the forms assigned to that person and their own submission history:
- **Your forms** — every published form reachable from the submitter's org, with live "needs
  correction" / "awaiting review" counts.
- **Real device capture** — photo and document-scan fields open the camera/file picker and upload
  straight to blob storage; signature fields are a real drawable pad; geo-point/geo-boundary fields
  read the browser's Geolocation API (point capture or walk-and-record a boundary), not typed
  coordinates.
- **My submissions** — grouped by flow stage, filterable by status (pending / needs correction /
  approved), with a sticky header for one-handed scrolling in the field.
- **Correction loop** — a returned submission reopens in the same capture UI with the reviewer's
  notes, and resubmits as a new version rather than overwriting history.
- **Cross-form record linking** — a field can require picking an existing upstream record (e.g. a
  transport leg must reference an approved feedstock delivery); exclusive links can only be claimed
  once, enforced race-safely at submit time (see [System architecture](#system-architecture)).

### Records
One row-wise table per form, not a form-by-form review queue — every question is a column, so
reviewing and reporting happen in the same screen instead of opening each record individually:
- **Type-aware cells, expanded inline** — a photo/document/signature or `geo_point`/`geo_boundary`
  answer is a chip that expands an enlarged panel directly beneath its row (capture metadata, or a
  real Leaflet map over satellite imagery with a road/place labels overlay, rendering the actual
  captured polygon) — a fluid accordion, not a modal, so the rest of the table stays visible and
  scrollable while reviewing the detail in depth.
- **Two review paths per row** — **Accept** the whole record in one click, or **Mark incorrect** to
  open a side panel and flag which *specific* answers are wrong with a remark per one; the flagged
  fields and remarks are surfaced back to the submitter on their own resubmit screen.
- **Version-aware columns** — a field removed from the form since a record was submitted is hidden
  by default (toggle it back on to inspect old data), and a field added *after* a record's version
  renders "not collected (pre-vN)" rather than an indistinguishable blank.
- **History, inline** — the whole-record review log, resubmission history, and automated
  smart-check summary are one click away from the record row, not a separate page.
- CSV export, scoped to the caller's own organization, same as before.

### Notifications
A bell in the top bar with an unread-count badge. Publishing a form fans out a notification to every
past real submitter ("this form changed, your data is safe under its original version") and a
confirmation to the publisher.

### Team & Access
Real **Invite user** flow (creates the `User` + a pending `OrgMembership` against a chosen role) and
an org ("partner") switcher for users who belong to more than one organization, gated the same way
as everything else — an Org Admin manages their own org's members and custom roles; a platform admin
can move between every organization.

### Analytics & Admin
Program-level throughput/backlog/telemetry dashboards computed live from each organization's real
`Submission`/`Device` rows (approval rate, correction turnaround, evidence completeness, device
coverage, weekly submission/correction trend) — an org with no activity yet gets an honest empty
state, not fabricated numbers. Admin gives platform-tier users the same view across every
organization and domain pack.

## Payments (Proximity Pay)

The money side of the same lifecycle: a buyer's offtake agreement isn't just a contract, it's a
milestone schedule with real evidence, real sign-off, and a real (if deliberately simulated)
settlement rail underneath it. This module — a much larger addition than any single feature above —
implements Phase 1 of a full payments-infrastructure design (see
[`CARBON_MARKETS_PAYMENTS_INFRA_DESIGN.md`](./CARBON_MARKETS_PAYMENTS_INFRA_DESIGN.md) in the repo
root) end to end, live against Postgres, with every dollar amount, KYC/BAV status, and payout
reference real data — just never a real bank transfer.

**The lifecycle, in order:**
1. A platform admin builds an agreement at `/payments/new` — buyer, project org, total value,
   milestone schedule (any mix of **Setup/CAPEX**, **Achievement**, and **Monitoring-cycle**
   milestones), a revenue-split rule set (platform / developer / farmer-community / investor, as
   percentages that must sum to 100), and the payout recipients' starting KYC/BAV status. Activating
   the agreement "funds" escrow — Proximity Pay's simulated buyer-collection leg.
2. A ground partner (the project org's own staff) opens the agreement and **submits a claim** on a
   milestone — a claimed amount plus evidence (a photo, a production log, a registry export, ...),
   the same construction-loan-draw-request pattern as a real financing workflow: the party doing the
   work requests funds, the platform doesn't auto-bill on a schedule.
3. Every required stakeholder — the investor, platform ops, and (for monitoring-cycle milestones
   only) the registry — records their consent on that specific claim, each seeing exactly which
   evidence they're approving and unable to consent on a claim they submitted themselves
   (segregation of duties, enforced server-side, not just hidden in the UI).
4. Once every required consent is in, the revenue-split engine computes each participant's share and
   creates a payout instruction per participant, each immediately checked against a **KYC/BAV dual
   gate** — a developer/farmer-community payout blocks independently of the others if *their*
   recipient's identity or bank-account verification isn't clear yet, shown as "blocked — BAV" (not
   a generic "pending"), with the other participants' payouts proceeding regardless.
5. A blocked payout can be released anyway via a **dual-authorization override** — both the ground
   partner and the investor have to sign off (never a single approver), and only once both
   signatures are on record does the payout clear.
6. Ops releases a ready payout — Proximity Pay "routes" it through a plausible fake corridor (UPI,
   mobile money, SWIFT wire, ...) and settles it, deducting from escrow and crediting the recipient's
   simulated Proximity Pay reference.
7. Every step above — claim, evidence, consent, gate check, override, payout — appends to a
   **hash-chained, append-only audit log**, one chain per agreement; a "Verify chain" button
   recomputes every entry's hash live and confirms nothing in the sequence has been altered.

**Where each persona actually reaches it:** platform admin and any non-submitter-tier org staff use
the full `/payments` screen in the main app shell; submitter-tier ground partners (who are otherwise
routed to the mobile Collect app, not the admin shell) reach the identical flow at
`/collect/payments`; investor and registry are new personas with no `OrgMembership`-based access at
all — a dedicated `PaymentAgreementParty` table grants them visibility into exactly the agreements
they're a party to, regardless of organization.

**What's real vs. simulated:** the milestone/claim/consent/gate state machine, the revenue-split
math, the escrow ledger (interest computed live from a core-portion accrual formula, never a stale
stored number), the dual-authorization mechanics, and the audit trail are all real, live-verified
logic against Postgres. Only the payment *rail* itself — "Proximity Pay" — is fake: no card network,
bank, or registry API is actually called; a payout reference is a generated string, not a real
transaction id. This mirrors the source design doc's own Phase 1 scope: model the workflow honestly
first, wire up real PSP/registry integrations later once the workflow itself is proven.

## Usage walkthrough

**Building a process (Org Admin / Designer):**
1. Forms & Stages → **New stage** for each step of the real-world process.
2. Inside a stage, **New form** (or add an existing one) and build its fields in the Form Builder.
3. Use **Preview** to sanity-check the form (including on a simulated mobile viewport) and submit a
   few test responses before publishing.
4. **Publish** the form — this is the point its fields become immutable history.
5. Flows → open the domain's flow → **Sync from stages** to lay the Stage/Form backbone into the
   graph automatically, then hand-add review gates, branches, or correction loops using the
   palette or the inspector's "Suggested next steps." **Validate graph**, then **Publish**.

**Running the process (Submitter / Reviewer):**
1. A submitter opens the **Collect** app on their phone, picks one of their assigned forms, fills
   it out (capturing real photos, signatures, and GPS as needed), and submits.
2. A reviewer opens the submission in Records (or the submitter sees it in "My submissions"),
   approves it or returns it for correction with a reason and guidance — a returned submission
   reopens in Collect for the same submitter to fix and resubmit.
3. If the underlying form is later republished, the reviewer and the original submitter are both
   notified, and the original submission keeps rendering against the version it was actually
   collected under.

**Administering connectors:** Connectors → **Add connector** → name it, pick its type (and protocol,
if industrial), optionally set an endpoint → bind it to a stage or a form's lookup source.

**Running a payment agreement (Platform admin → ground partner → investor/registry → ops):**
1. Payments → **New agreement** → set the buyer, project org, milestone schedule, and revenue split
   → **Activate** (funds escrow).
2. A ground partner opens the agreement, picks a milestone, and **Submits a claim** with evidence.
3. The investor (and registry, for a monitoring-cycle milestone) and platform ops each record their
   consent on that claim from their own login — once all are in, payout instructions are created
   and gate-checked automatically.
4. Ops **releases** any payout that cleared the KYC/BAV gate; a blocked one can be released via a
   **dual-authorization override** once both the ground partner and the investor sign off.
5. The audit trail at the bottom of the agreement records every step — click **Verify chain** at any
   point to confirm it hasn't been tampered with.

## Local development

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # set DATABASE_URL (any Postgres) and AUTH_SECRET
npm install                 # postinstall runs `prisma generate`
npm run db:migrate           # applies prisma/migrations
npm run db:seed              # inserts every seeded org/user/stage/form/flow/submission
npm run dev
```

Add `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` (from your Vercel project's Storage tab) if you want to actually capture
photos/signatures/documents in the Collect app — everything else runs without it.

Every seeded user signs in with their real email and the shared demo password `demo1234` (override
with `SEED_DEMO_PASSWORD`). The login page lists a few to try — logging in as different personas is
the fastest way to see the RBAC view/edit boundaries for real. `npm run db:studio` opens Prisma
Studio to inspect the database directly.

## Deployment

See [`DEPLOY.md`](./DEPLOY.md) for full steps. Short version: both paths need `DATABASE_URL` and a
per-environment `AUTH_SECRET`.

- **Vercel** — import the repo, add the two env vars, set the build command to
  `prisma migrate deploy && next build`, deploy, seed once from your machine.
- **Google Cloud (Cloud Run + Cloud SQL)** — this repo ships a multi-stage `Dockerfile`
  (`output: "standalone"`, Prisma engine binaries copied explicitly). Attach Cloud SQL via its Unix
  socket, run the migration once as a Cloud Run Job, then deploy.

## Prototype boundaries & roadmap

Flagged explicitly rather than silently glossed over — this list reflects the actual code today,
not a stale snapshot:

- **No server-side validation that submitted answers match the form's actual field set.** The
  Collect app enforces required fields client-side, but the collect API route accepts whatever
  answers array it's given rather than cross-checking it against the published form's fields.
- **`single_select` / `multi_select` fields render as free-text inputs**, in both Collect and the
  Form Builder's Preview — the field *type* and its options are modeled and stored, but there's no
  real dropdown/checkbox UI yet, which defeats controlled-vocabulary data quality for those fields.
- **`repeat_group` has no Collect-side renderer.** It's offered as a field type in the Form Builder,
  but a submitter has no way to fill in a repeating group of sub-fields yet.
- **Most API routes don't wrap their Prisma calls in try/catch** — a database hiccup surfaces as an
  opaque 500 rather than a structured error response.
- **The seed script's shared demo password (`demo1234`)** is fine for this seeded dataset but would
  be a real weakness if `prisma/seed.ts` were ever run against a production database as-is.
- **Payments is Phase 1 of a larger design, by intent** ([full design doc](./CARBON_MARKETS_PAYMENTS_INFRA_DESIGN.md)):
  "Proximity Pay" never calls a real card network, bank, or registry API — every payout reference,
  routing corridor, and settlement is a simulation, deliberately, so the claim/consent/gate workflow
  could be built and proven honestly before any real PSP integration, licensing, or registry-API
  work begins. Also not yet built: real PSP/mass-payout partner integration, real registry API
  polling for monitoring-cycle milestones (registry confirmation is a first-party portal action
  today, which the design doc treats as a legitimate permanent fallback, not just a stopgap),
  receivables financing (Phase 4 in the source design), and CSV export for the Payments audit trail
  (Records already has this; Payments doesn't yet).
- **The two new Payments demo personas (investor, registry) carry a real `OrgMembership`** in
  `org-varaha-south` purely so existing login/session plumbing works for them — their actual access
  comes from `PaymentAgreementParty`, but this means they show up in that org's own Team & Access
  member list too, which is accurate (they are members, for login purposes) but could read as odd
  to an org admin who doesn't know why an investor contact is sitting in their team roster.

None of the above affect the things that matter most for field data integrity — tenant isolation,
form-version pinning, review/correction history, and exclusive-link race safety are all real and
verified (see [System architecture](#system-architecture)). The same is true on the Payments side:
segregation of duties, the dual-authorization override (including the concurrent-signer race
condition, found and fixed with a `Serializable` transaction — mirroring the exclusive-link-claim
pattern above), and the hash-chained audit trail are all real and live-verified, not just modeled.
